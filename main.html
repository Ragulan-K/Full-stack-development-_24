            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>An adaptable and responsible graduate seeking an entry-level position in engineering
                that will utilize the technical and creative skills developed as an undergraduate during professional training sessions. During my
                degree, I successfully combined my studies with work and other commitments showing
                myself to be self-motivated, organized, and capable of working under pressure. I have a
                clear, logical mind with a practical approach to problem-solving and a drive to see things
                through to completion. I enjoy working on my own initiative or in a team. I am a reliable, trustworthy, hardworking individual
                with a genuine interest in engineering .</p>
